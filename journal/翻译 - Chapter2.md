# Chapter2. Grammars as a Generating Device

> 2.1 Languages as Infinite Sets

```
In computer science as in everyday parlance, a “grammar” serves to “describe” a “language”. If taken at face value, this correspondence, however, is misleading, since the computer scientist and the naive speaker mean slightly different things by the three terms. To establish our terminology and to demarcate the universe of discourse, we shall examine the above terms, starting with the last one.

就像日常用语一样，在计算机科学中，“文法”时用来“描述”一种“语言”的。然而如果从表面上看是具有误导性的，因为计算机科学家和普通的说话者对这三个术语含义的理解时略有不同的。为了建立我们的术语并划定话语世界，我们将从最后一个开始研究上面的术语。

> 2.1.1 Language

```
To the larger part of mankind, language is first and foremost a means of communication, to be used almost unconsciously, certainly so in the heat of a debate. Communication is brought about by sending messages, through air vibrations or through written symbols. Upon a closer look the language message (“utterances”) fall apart into sentences, which are composed of words, which in turn consist of symbol sequences when written. Languages can differ on all three levels of composition. The script can be slightly different, as between English and Irish, or very different, as between English and Chinese. Words tend to differ greatly, and even in closely related languages people call un cheval or ein Pferd, that which is known to others as a horse. Differences in sentence structure are often underestimated; even the closely related Dutch often has an almost Shakespearean word order: “Ik geloof je niet”, “I believe you not”, and more distantly related languages readily come up with constructions like the Hungarian “Pénzem van”, “Money-my is”, where the English say “I have money”.

对于大部分人来说，语言首先是一种交流方式，几乎无意识地使用语言，当然在激烈的辩论中也是如此。交流是通过空气振动或通过文字符号携带信息来实现。仔细观察，语言信息会分解成句子，这些句子由单词组成，而单词在书写时又由符号序列组成。语言在所有三个构成层面上都可以不同。字母可能略有不同，如英语和爱尔兰育，或者非常不同，如英语和汉语。语言往往差别很大，甚至在人们熟知的语言中，人们将马称为“un cheval”或“ein Pferd”。句子结构的差异经常被低估。即使是紧密相关的荷兰人，也经常有一种近乎莎士比亚式地语句：“lk geloof je niet”，“i believe you not”，而更多相关的语言很容易找到像匈牙利语“Penzem van”，“money-my is”的结构，而英语中则是“I hava money”。
